a) 

On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	./

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

b) 9 commits have been made, the command used to get this number is: git log --pretty=oneline | wc -l 

c) Wed Sep 25 18:13:30 2019, git log --grep .gitignore.

d) Branches are used to encapsulate work and to avoid constant merge conflictions.

e) git log shows commits. git status shows how up to date you are and what files have been changed.

*f) git log --nameonly --grep Vehicle.h

*g) git log --oneline --grep file

h) 	Inerhitance is the act of inheriting properties from an object.
	Polymorphism is the modification of properties of a parent object.	
	Encapsulation is only exposing and using relevant functionalities through abstraction.

i) 	In the integration manager model a single entity oversees the integration of all contributions. While
	in the dictator & lieutenants workflow there are multiple integration managers which oversee a seperate
	pieces of functionality.
	
j)	A 100 person development team would benefit more from the D&L workflow with less management there will
	be more merge conflictions. An with more merge conflictions, more money is burnt.
